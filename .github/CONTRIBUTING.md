# Contributing

This library's source code is mainly generated from JSON schema in the [Google CloudEvents repo](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents).

Specifically, the `google-cloudevents-types/src` directory is generated and should not be modified as changes will be overwritten when the library is re-generated. Rather, the upstream CloudEvents repo should be modified.

## Generate API types

Before generating the library, you must set up your environment like such:
- Have Java 11+ and Node (for generation) installed.
- Install the [quicktype wrapper CLI](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents/tree/master/tools/quicktype-wrapper) using npm.
- Clone the [google-cloudevents](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents) source of truth repo in the same directory as this repo.

Then, to generate, run the ./gen.sh file in the java repo. This will generate the whole library with the source of truth JSON schemas.

```sh
./tools/gen.sh
```

Observe the new files in `src/`.

## Test
  
Run tests:

```sh
mvn test
```

## Prepublish Checklist

Install the library to ensure it builds correctly:

```
mvn install -Dclirr.skip
```
