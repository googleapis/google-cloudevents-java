     * A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`,
     * `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example,

     * field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The map
     * keys, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be
     * empty.
     *
     * Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields
     * defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by the simple
     * or quoted field names of the containing fields, delimited by `.`. For
     * example, the structured field
     * `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be
     * represented by the field path `foo.x&y`.
     *
     * Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and
     * may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be
     * escaped using a `\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and
